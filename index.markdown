Hi there, I'm a Computer Science Ph.D. student specializing in **education data mining** and **learning technologies**. My research focuses on user behavior models (quantitative and qualitative), performance prediction (statistical machine learning), and innovative learning experiences (UX and user studies). I have 5+ years of development experience in `Python` (for statistical analysis, machine learning, data visualization, web applications), `Java` (for Android and general programming), and `C#` (Unity, Augmented Reality).
