## Keeping Technical Documents as a Software Developer

I always say that the best training I received during the Ph.D. years is documentation. Or more specifically, I built the mindset that values documentation more than anything in software development. 

Whenever possible, I keep documents for others and myself in the future.

Keeping a docuemnt that fits the need of technical requirements and friendly to your potential readers is far more difficult than it sounds like. In my experience, I have seen people emphasize on the value of documents; however, in reality, we usually fail to put themselves in the reader's shoes due to the inevitable complexity of documentation.

It is obvious for almost all people that, when we are working as a teammate, documents serve as a major media to transfer working knowledge. In my opinion, I prefer generalizing this collaboration to a broader sense: we are always collaborating others, not only with the current or potential colleagues, but also ourselves now and tomorrow.
