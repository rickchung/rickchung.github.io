# Summary

I'm a Computer Science Ph.D. student specializing in **education data mining** and **learning technologies**. My research focuses on user behavior models (quantitative and qualitative), performance prediction (statistical machine learning), and innovative learning experiences (UX and user studies). I have 5+ years of development experience in `Python` (for statistical analysis, machine learning, data visualization, web applications), `Java` (for Android and general programming), and `C#` (Unity, Augmented Reality).  

# Skills

- Statistical analysis and machine learning in **user behavior models**
- Augmented Reality (AR) app development in Unity (Unity Editor, C#).
- Deep learning models (TensorFlow, Keras)
- Data processing at scale (Apache Spark)
- Web development (Django, HTML/CSS, JavaScript)
- Database management (SQL and object models)
- General programming in Python, R, C, JavaScript, Unix/Linux shell scripts (bash, zsh)


# Education

- 2017-2022 (Expected)
  - Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, U.S.A.
  - **Ph.D. in Computer Science**


- 2012-2016
  - National Sun Yat-Sun University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan
  - **B.S. in Management Information Systems**



# Research Projects

**Student Behavior Models in Self-Assessment and Practice**

- Researched and implemented probabilistic and multilevel regression models to analyze students’ online learning/practicing behavior.
- Improved the research design iteratively by exploratory data analyses.

**Augmented Reality Learning Experiences for Computer Programming ([Link](https://sites.google.com/asu.edu/ogmented/home))**

- Designed and developed an AR-enabled mobile app by Unity and C# to deliver an AR-enabled learning experience.
- Designed and conducted user studies to evaluate user experience by quantitative data analyses in Python.
