# Summary

I'm a Computer Science Ph.D. student specializing in **education data mining** and **learning technologies**. My research focuses on user behavior models (quantitative and qualitative), performance prediction (statistical machine learning), and innovative learning experiences (UX and user studies). I have 5+ years of development experience in `Python` (for statistical analysis, machine learning, data visualization, web applications), `Java` (for Android and general programming), and `C#` (Unity, Augmented Reality).  

# Skills

- Statistical analysis and machine learning in **user behavior models**
- Augmented Reality (AR) app development in Unity (Unity Editor, C#).
- Deep learning models (TensorFlow, Keras)
- Data processing at scale (Apache Spark)
- Web development (Django, HTML/CSS, JavaScript)
- Database management (SQL and object models)
- General programming in Python, R, C, JavaScript, Unix/Linux shell scripts (bash, zsh)


# Education
